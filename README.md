# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview of The Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees at Pewlett-Hackard, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
In Deliverables 1 & 2, I have created the following tables:

- Retirement Titles table
- Unique Titles table
- Retiring Titles table
- Mentorship Eligibility table

### Retirement Titles
I performed an inner join from the employees and titles tables on the primary key into a new table called retirement_titles. I filtered the data on birth_date column to retrieve the employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 and then ordered the data by employee number.
